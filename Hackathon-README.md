## Project Explanation
Our project is a comparison project between different algorithms in Artificial Intelligence trained and tested on environments from the MineRL competitions.
Most of the algorithms are submissions of different teams from the 2019-2022 competitions.

This README is for the Hackathon only because it's on algorithms from colab notebooks.
